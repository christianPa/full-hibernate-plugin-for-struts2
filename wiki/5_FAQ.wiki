=== I was using the Hibernate Session Plugin. Do I need to migrate? ===

The Hibernate Session Plugin will be depreated. Will not be continued. The Full Hibernate Plugin contain the the Hibernate Session injection feature and much more.

Yes. The are 3 ways:

1. Using the *basicStackHibernate* interceptor stack (Struts2 basickStack + Session and Transaction injection)

2. Using the *defaultStackHibernateStrutsValidation* (Struts2 defaultStack + Session and Transaction injection)

3. Using the *com.googlecode.s2hibernate.struts2.plugin.s2hibernatesession.HibernateSessionInterceptor* class as an Interceptor in a custom Interceptors Stack.
